## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Research phase first to validate AUTH-01 and SEARCH-03 viability before implementation
- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from requirement clustering, Research split from Foundation for focus
- [Roadmap]: SEARCH-03 now conditional on RESEARCH-01 confirming API query transparency

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RESEARCH-01 outcome determines AUTH-01 scope (may descope Gemini CLI auth if no grounded search support)
- RESEARCH-01 outcome determines SEARCH-03 scope (may descope if API doesn't return search queries)
