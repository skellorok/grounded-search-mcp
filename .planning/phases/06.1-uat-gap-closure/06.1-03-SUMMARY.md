# Phase 06.1 Plan 03: Claude Code Skills Summary

**Two slash command skills for DX: /grounded-search:query (save results to files) and /grounded-search:prep-gsd (GSD integration wizard)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-05T10:07:42Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-05T10:08:46Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Created /grounded-search:query skill for saving search results to markdown files
- Created /grounded-search:prep-gsd skill for configuring GSD framework integration
- Both skills reference correct MCP tool naming (mcp__grounded-search__*)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create /grounded-search:query skill** - `7098cf8` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create /grounded-search:prep-gsd skill** - `6d7c241` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `.claude/skills/grounded-search/query.md` - Slash command to save search results to timestamped files in ./grounded-search-results/
- `.claude/skills/grounded-search/prep-gsd.md` - Slash command to check and configure GSD agents for grounded search integration

## Decisions Made
- Skills use simple YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields
- Query skill generates timestamped filenames (YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-{slug}.md) to avoid conflicts
- Prep-gsd skill is idempotent - always checks current state before proposing changes
- Prep-gsd waits for explicit user confirmation before applying any changes

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward skill file creation.

## User Setup Required

None - skills are automatically discovered by Claude Code from .claude/skills/ directory.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Skills ready for use in any project with grounded-search-mcp configured
- Plan 04 (documentation updates) can proceed with skills as reference
- Users can run /grounded-search:query to save search results
- Users can run /grounded-search:prep-gsd to set up GSD integration
