## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Fallback reason displayed in response
expected: When a search fails on primary provider and falls back to secondary, the response shows a specific reason (e.g., "429 (rate limited)", "503 (service unavailable)") instead of just "Fallback provider used"
result: pass

### 2. Non-auth errors trigger fallback
expected: If primary provider returns 404, 500, timeout, or other non-auth error, the search automatically tries the secondary provider instead of just failing
result: pass

### 3. WebSearch suggestion on complete failure
expected: When both providers fail, the response includes a suggestion to try WebSearch as an alternative
result: skipped
reason: Hard to simulate both authenticated providers failing simultaneously

### 4. Package renamed to grounded-search-mcp
expected: Running `npm pkg get name` in the project shows "grounded-search-mcp", and the bin command is also "grounded-search-mcp"
result: pass

### 5. Token storage uses new path
expected: After authenticating, tokens are stored at ~/.config/grounded-search-mcp/ (not google-search-mcp or gemini-search-mcp)
result: pass

### 6. /grounded-search:query skill works
expected: Running /grounded-search:query with a search query saves results to a timestamped markdown file in ./grounded-search-results/ directory
result: pass

### 7. /grounded-search:prep-gsd skill works
expected: Running /grounded-search:prep-gsd checks current GSD configuration and proposes agent override changes if grounded_search tool isn't configured
result: pass

### 8. README uses grounded-search-mcp naming
expected: README.md references "grounded-search-mcp" throughout (title, config examples, installation commands) with no "gemini-search-mcp" references
result: pass

### 9. GSD integration guide documents agent override
expected: docs/gsd-integration.md explains the agent override priority (CLI flag > project > user > plugin) and which agents benefit from grounded_search
result: issue
reported: "shouldn't have replaced the old documentation, should have added the automated method with the command but kept the manual instructions as well"
severity: major

### 10. Source URLs are actual destinations (not redirects)
expected: Source citations show actual destination URLs (e.g., accuweather.com, weather.gov) not Google redirect URLs (vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/...)
result: issue
reported: "Sources show redirect URLs (vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/...) instead of actual destination URLs. This breaks WebFetch follow-up which is critical for GSD research agents - they need to fetch content from sources Claude deems important. Potentially makes project unusable for GSD integration."
severity: blocker
