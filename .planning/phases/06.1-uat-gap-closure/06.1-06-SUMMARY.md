# Phase 6.1 Plan 06: GSD Integration Guide Restoration Summary

**Comprehensive GSD guide with both automated prep-gsd command AND detailed manual instructions, including Prerequisites, The Challenge explanation, and Maintenance Considerations**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-05T16:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-05T16:03:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Restored Prerequisites section (installation, auth, GSD requirements)
- Restored The Challenge section explaining WHY tool lists are hard constraints
- Restored Alternative: Wildcard Tool Access section
- Restored Project-Level Configuration section (PROJECT.md, CONTEXT.md, teams)
- Restored Maintenance Considerations section (update strategy, minimal override)
- Restored Complete Override Example section
- Added gsd-debugger to agent table and copy commands
- Added Authentication Errors troubleshooting section
- Kept improved Agent Override Mechanism priority table
- Kept /grounded-search:prep-gsd quick start automation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Merge improved and original guide content** - `094611e` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `docs/gsd-integration.md` - Complete GSD integration guide with 11 major sections

## Decisions Made

- **Keep improved override mechanism:** The priority table from 06.1-04 is accurate and helpful, so it was preserved
- **Restore all explanatory content:** Users benefit from understanding WHY, not just HOW
- **Include gsd-debugger:** Original guide included it, current version omitted it - restored for completeness
- **Maintain grounded-search naming:** All references use grounded-search (no legacy gemini-search)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - straightforward documentation merge.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- GSD integration documentation is now complete and comprehensive
- Users can choose between automated (/grounded-search:prep-gsd) or manual setup
- Gap closure for documentation is complete
