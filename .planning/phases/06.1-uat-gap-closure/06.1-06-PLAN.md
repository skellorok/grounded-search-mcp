<objective>
Restore comprehensive manual instructions to GSD integration guide while keeping improved structure.

Purpose: Commit 0bfb58e improved the override mechanism explanation but removed valuable manual setup details. Users who prefer manual configuration or need to understand the "why" lost important context. This plan merges the improved content with restored original sections.

Output: Complete guide with both automated and manual approaches, plus explanatory context.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Merge improved and original guide content</name>
  <files>docs/gsd-integration.md</files>
  <action>
Rewrite docs/gsd-integration.md to merge current improved structure with restored original content.

Final structure should be:

1. **Header + Quick Start** (KEEP from current)
   - Title and intro
   - /grounded-search:prep-gsd quick start

2. **Prerequisites** (RESTORE from original)
   - grounded-search-mcp installed and configured
   - Authentication complete
   - GSD framework installed
   - auth --status verification command

3. **The Challenge** (RESTORE from original)
   - Explains WHY tool lists are hard constraints
   - Shows example frontmatter with tool list
   - Explains agent cannot use tools not in list

4. **How It Works** (KEEP from current - improved)
   - Agent Override Mechanism with priority table
   - Which Agents to Modify (phase-researcher, project-researcher)
   - ADD gsd-debugger to the table (was in original)

5. **Manual Setup** (EXPAND significantly)
   Keep current 5 steps but add detail from original:
   - Step 1: Create directory (keep)
   - Step 2: Copy agents (keep, add gsd-debugger)
   - Step 3: Modify tool lists (keep, add wildcard alternative inline)
   - Step 4: Add preference instruction (keep)
   - Step 5: Configure MCP server (keep)

6. **Alternative: Wildcard Tool Access** (RESTORE from original)
   - mcp__grounded-search__* wildcard option
   - Lists all tools granted

7. **Project-Level Configuration** (RESTORE from original)
   - In PROJECT.md section
   - In Phase CONTEXT.md section
   - Team standardization use case

8. **Saving Research Results** (KEEP from current)
   - /grounded-search:query command

9. **Troubleshooting** (MERGE both versions)
   - Keep current Agent Not Using section
   - Keep current GSD Update section
   - Keep current Tool Not Found section
   - Add Authentication Errors section from original

10. **Maintenance Considerations** (RESTORE from original)
    - GSD agents update frequently warning
    - Recommended approach (diff, periodic check, re-apply)
    - Minimal override strategy

11. **Complete Override Example** (RESTORE from original)
    - Full example with frontmatter and body
    - Shows minimal changes needed

Key naming updates:
- Update all refs from gemini-search to grounded-search
- Update tool names: mcp__grounded-search__grounded_search
- Keep server key as grounded-search (matches .mcp.json)

<verification>
1. Read through docs/gsd-integration.md - should have 10+ sections
2. Verify these restored sections exist:
   - Prerequisites
   - The Challenge
   - Alternative: Wildcard Tool Access
   - Project-Level Configuration
   - Maintenance Considerations
   - Complete Override Example
3. Verify improved content kept:
   - Agent Override Mechanism priority table
   - /grounded-search:prep-gsd quick start
4. Verify all naming is grounded-search (grep for gemini-search should return 0)

<success_criteria>
- Guide has both automated AND manual setup instructions
- Original explanatory sections restored (Prerequisites, Challenge, Maintenance)
- Improved structure and accuracy from current version preserved
- No gemini-search references remaining (all grounded-search)
- User can choose between quick automated setup or detailed manual control
</success_criteria>
